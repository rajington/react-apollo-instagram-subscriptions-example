## Getting Started

After [downloading this example](https://github.com/graphcool-examples/react-apollo-instagram-subscriptions-example/archive/master.zip) please follow these steps.

### 1. Create an account

To run this example, please create a [graph.cool](http://graph.cool) account and **copy your endpoint**. This shouldn't take longer than a minute. We promise!

This is how our GraphQL data model should look like:

```graphql
type Post {
  description: String!
  imageUrl: String!
}
```

### 2. Configure app data endpoint

Open `src/index.js` and paste your endpoint to the following line:

```js
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface('https://api.graph.cool/simple/v1/__PROJECT_ID__')
```

### 3. Run the example

You're done configuring the example application. Please run the following command and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. Make sure to open two or more tabs with the page to see subscriptions in action. Have fun exploring! 🎉

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

### 4. Subscriptions Debugger

You can use the [subscriptions debugger](http://graphcool-subscriptions-debugger.surge.sh/) to test subscriptions.

Simply run a subscription query to subscribe
